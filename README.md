# Text-based RPG game

This is a text-based role-playing game that allows you to create your own character and explore different rooms. You will encounter various enemies and allies, and collect different objects to aid you in your journey.

## **Gameplay**

 At the start of the game, you will create a character by choosing their name, class (warrior, mage, or rogue), and attributes (attack, defense, health, and knowledge).

You will then be placed in a room and given a list of options to choose from. You can choose to explore the room, search for objects, fight enemies, or talk to allies. Depending on the option you choose, you will have to perform certain actions, such as rolling dice to determine your attack or defense.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter different enemies, allies, and objects. Enemies will have their own attributes and attacks, and defeating them will reward you with experience points and loot. Allies can join your party and provide benefits such as increased health or knowledge. Objects can be collected and used to increase your own attributes, heal your character, or deal damage to enemies.

The game ends when you defeat the final boss, located in the last room of the game.

## Objects

** There are several different types of objects that you can collect throughout the game. These include:

**Common objects:** These are objects that can be found in most rooms and provide basic benefits, such as increased health or attack. 
**Special objects:** These are rarer objects that provide more powerful benefits, such as increased dodge chance or knowledge. 
**Epic objects:** These are very rare objects that provide significant benefits, such as increased defense and attack. 
**Legendary objects:** These are the rarest objects in the game and provide the most powerful benefits, such as increased health, attack, and knowledge. Each object has a name, rarity, and effect that will be applied when the object is used.

## Rooms

 There are 10 different rooms in the game, each with its own name and difficulty level. The rooms are arranged in increasing difficulty, with the final room being the hardest. Each room contains enemies, allies, and objects that can be interacted with.

## Allies

 Allies are characters that can join your party and provide benefits such as increased health or knowledge. There are six allies in the game, each with their own name and benefits. Allies can be found in different rooms and can be recruited by talking to them.

## Enemies

 Enemies are characters that you will encounter throughout the game. Each enemy has its own attributes, attacks, and difficulty level. Defeating enemies will reward you with experience points and loot.
